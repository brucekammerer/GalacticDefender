**Galactic Defender** is an exciting version of the popular Space Shooter game, developed in **Construct 2**. In this game, you take control of a spaceship tasked with defeating enemy ships. You will encounter four different types of enemy ships, each with varying levels of difficulty—some are easy to destroy, while others present a greater challenge.

As you eliminate enemy ships, you earn points that contribute to your score. However, be cautious: if an enemy ship collides with your spaceship, you will lose one life.

To aid you in your mission, the game features a power-up—a shield that grants temporary invincibility, allowing you to take down opponents without taking damage.

**Galactic Defender** supports controls for both computers and mobile devices, making it accessible for all players. Get ready to embark on an interstellar adventure and prove your skills as a defender of the galaxy!
